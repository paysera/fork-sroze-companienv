# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for Symfony 6 and 7.4.
- A PHPUnit test suite.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that runs the tests on every PHP and Symfony combination it lists, with the lowest and the highest dependencies.

### Changed
- PHP 7.1 or later is required.
- `symfony/console`, `symfony/dotenv` and `symfony/process` 4.4 or later are required on the 4.x line.
- `jackiedo/dotenv-editor` 1.1.1 or later is required.
- The development dependencies install on every PHP and Symfony combination the workflow runs.
- The console command accepts an empty answer to a question whose default is empty, as the Composer script does, instead of asking again.

### Fixed
- The `companienv` console command failed on Symfony 5 and later.
- RSA key and SSL certificate generation failed with `symfony/process` 5 and later.
- Declining RSA key or SSL certificate generation asked the same question again for the other variables of the pair.
- A `#+file-to-propagate` file that existed was reported as missing configuration on every run, and a missing one was not asked for when its variable was already set.
- Without interaction, a question with no default (the RSA pass phrase, the SSL domain name, the path of a file to propagate) failed with a `TypeError` in the Composer script and was asked again without end in the console command. It now fails with a `Companienv\IO\UnansweredQuestionException`, a `RuntimeException` that names the question.
- Without interaction, the console command asked again without end for a variable whose default is empty. It now writes the empty value, as the Composer script does.
- In the Composer script, an empty answer to a question with no default failed with a `TypeError`. The question is now asked again, as the console command does.
- A value containing whitespace, `#`, a quote or a backslash was written without quotes, so Dotenv could not read the `.env` file or read a different value. Such a value is now written in quotes. A value that is already in quotes is written as it is.
- PHP 8.1+ deprecation notices from `jackiedo/dotenv-editor` 1.2.0 and earlier when writing a variable.
- PHP 8.4 deprecations for implicitly nullable parameters.

### Security
- Key paths, the pass phrase and the domain name are no longer interpreted by a shell.
- The domain name is escaped for openssl's subject syntax, so `/`, `+` and `\` in it no longer add subject fields or make openssl fail.
- The RSA pass phrase is passed to openssl on standard input instead of the command line.
